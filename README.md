What is this purpose of this Git repository? 

The purpose of this git repo is to document and store all the past labs and assignments I've completed over the course of taking COMP 20.

What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

My favorite assignment would be the notuber assignment, because learning to parse data and use the google maps API was very fulfilling.

How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

I've learnt a great deal of web programming, as well as how to be resourceful and code independently. I'd say the course experience has made me a more well rounded programmer, as well as exposed me to a lot of important real life code principles. I think I've grown a lot after taking this course.

What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.

Again, one important thing I've learned is how to be resourceful. I realized that the same website could be built in so many different ways, that it's really up to the programmer to explore all the possible tools, frameworks and languages and decide on which one is the best. I heavily used google and stack overflow to help with completing my assignments, and I feel more confident coding independently. Another important thing that I learned is how critical security is. I never gave much thought to this topic before, and I hadn't realized how insecure a lot of websites online are. It made more careful as a programmer as well as more cautious as a user on the web.

Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

I would like to learn more about front end frameworks.
